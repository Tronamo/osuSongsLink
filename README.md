# osuSongsLink

### **My first repo how awesome.**

Parses osu folder for song audiofiles and generates a directory with hardlinks to them.

Probably can use for spotify or whatever media player.

Just for fun! i love python

## TODO:

maybe maybe not
  - UI
    - loading bar would be fire
    - see song being loaded as it happens
  - multithreading?
  - outputInfo.txt
    - idk what it could contain yet
  - get metadata from osu file(s)
  - use diff names
  - option to ignore tv size/cut ver/short ver
    - keyword include and ignore!
